A few notes:
  I apologize for the lateness, I was on a tight deadline in my current full-time job.
  This is my first time ever using Vue.js and I thoroughly enjoyed it (though it came with a few learning curves), I can easily see why you guys want to add this to use this framework as it is so easy to inject anywhere into a pre-existing codebase.
  I had extremely high goals for this project but as per the usual case, time was the most limiting factor. I attempted to showcase my css skills in a specific components like the header, and login plus responsiveness everywhere. 
  In other areas I focused on the javascript data-flow side of things and tried to oragnize the app in a structure that would be able to scale (without Vuex obviously which I kind of regret not implementing)
  
  Hope you enjoy.. any feedback appreciated
